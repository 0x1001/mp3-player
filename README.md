# mp3-player
Music player for kids. Each button plays different mp3. All mp3s have to be loaded on SD card with names 1.mp3, 2.mp3, ... .
It requires 3xAA batteries. Battery life time is several hours long (playing music).

Plastic cover I bought in electric shop and I drilled all holes for buttons, leds and a speaker. This device can be a lot smaller :).
